        <h1> The Annotated Waves Playlist</h1>
        <h2><i>Waves</i></a> is practically a musical.</h2>
        <p style= text-align:center>From the earliest drafts of the script to the final edit of the film, writer-director Trey Edward Shults embedded into every scene his own idiosyncratic, achingly personal song choices. 
            These songs reveal his characters' inner lives; they are intimate extensions of the images and themes of the film; they're essential. (Just check out the first line of the script: 
            “Music slowly builds as we pass over pavement in EXTREME SLOW MOTION.”) Here, Shults annotates, in order, each of the 39 songs in the film. Listen along as you read and you'll hear the whole movie in your head.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364> FloriDada</i> by Animal Collective</h3> 
            <p>I love Animal Collective, I love Florida, and I love the energy and chaos in this song. Waves is about the messy human experience and the <a href="Dichotomy.html" data-content="Link Hover" class="glow"> dichotomies of life</a>
               —pain vs. beauty, good vs. bad, individual vs. family. It's no coincidence that we chose to just use the bridge of this song. Bridges are a strong visual motif used throughout the film—we begin and end with bridges
               <br>
               <br>
                <i> Where's the bridge that's gonna take me home <br></i>
                <i>The bridge that someone's fighting over<br></i>
                <i>A bridge that someone's paying for<br></i>
                <i>A bridge so old so let it go<br></i>
            </p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Be Above It</i> by Tame Impala</h3>
            <p>This is one of my favorite Tame Impala songs, and the perfect way to introduce the audience to the drive of Tyler's world. To me, the repeated whispers "Gotta be above it" gives us an inside look into his mind. The first time I heard it, I was obsessed. We chose to combine the studio and live version because the instrumentals were like an overture to the film.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Mitsubishi Sony</i> by Frank Ocean</h3>
            <p>I liked using tracks from <i>Endless</i> in the film because it's less familiar than Frank’s other albums like Blonde, and Channel Orange. This is the remastered version of <i>“Mitsubishi Sony,”</i> which was one of the few songs that wasn’t in the script. It was originally the extended overture, but the music just fit the film, so when I was editing I decided to throw it in. It feels like the high you get when you are up late partying with the people you love. This song also works in tandem with the kids singing “Shut the fuck up” a Waves original that Alexis started improvising in the car when she told me to “Shut the fuck up” giving her directions over the walkie.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>What A Difference a Day Makes</i> by Dinah Washington</h3>
            <p>I remember when this song came on the first time I saw Chunking Express—I was in love. I think it’s a little bit of an homage to that film, and a nostalgic nod to my childhood. Lyrically, it’s also the next day in Tyler’s life and in our story, we are in church and getting more of a feel for family life. While the lyrics of the song take on a heartbreaking meaning later on in the film, they still also feel hopeful. Even though one mistake can change our lives forever, there is always a new day to heal. After we shot this scene, Kelvin’s real mom started singing this song when he got home. She said she used to sing this song to him all the time when he was little. It felt so meant to be.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>La Linda Luna</i> by Kelvin Harrison Jr.</h3>
            <p>This was a Kelvin original, truth be told he is a true musical prodigy. Kelvin’s dad is an incredible musician and their dynamic inspired many things in the film. Named La Linda Luna after Alexis’s middle name, Luna —a pretty moon. We wanted to explore how relationships unravel, how two people who love each other can fall into such a sad place.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Lvl</i> by A$AP Rocky</h3>
            <p>This is one of my favorite cuts in the film, the sound of this beat rising with the MRI machine is how we get to watch the music syncing with the visuals, right before Tyler’s life is changed forever. The title is what life is for me, full of ups and downs everyone is on a different level.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Bad News</i> by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>This is the first time we hear score in the film, it comes right after Tyler gets the results from his MRI, and we see it instantly pulls him apart. I saved the score until this moment because I wanted it to feel different from the soundtrack. Trent and Atticus manipulated sounds from the film in this track which really brings us inside Tyler’s headspace. The piano is another big element of the score, as Tyler plays we watch his innocence slipping away, while he tries to hold on. This score reveals the internal war he’s having with himself and his emotions.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Odds Against</i> by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>Picking up where <i> Bad News</i> left off, we’ve just witnessed the tense dynamic between Tyler and his dad. A parent’s expectations raging against the insurmountable pressure of success. This was a very personal song—I still have the scars on my shoulder from tearing it wrestling in high school. My entire world fell apart and everything I had worked for was lost. I took a bad video media class and that was what saved me, it forced me to pick up a camera and film things again. It was a dream come true to work with Trent and Atticus on this film.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Rushes</i> by Frank Ocean</h3>
            <p><i>Twin peaking highs and lows.</i>One of my favorite Frank tracks to explore the highs and lows of relationships. I remember when we shot Tyler and Alexis in the water the Florida heat lightning started and it felt magical. We used this song as a mirror of what’s to come in the second half of the film.
            <i>Hope the water’s deep enough.</i></p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Backseat Freestyle</i> by Kendrick Lamar</h3>
            <p>Kelvin had to memorize the lyrics the day of shooting. We slowed it down to echo Tyler’s state of mind and lost high. Kendrick said this track is him reconstructing the mindset of his 16 year old self, which feels so fitting for this moment where Tyler is trying to rebel and escape his hurt. It works as a release but only for a moment.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Everything Burns</i> by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>This track brings out Tyler’s hurt and regret, dreaming about his lost love as the relationship begins to disintegrate. The shots of Tyler and Alexis through the fire are some of my favorite shots in the film. Trent and Atticus establish this recurring theme, which is heard in two more pivotal moments of loss and pain. Water is such a central focus of this movie, with some of the biggest moments of connection between characters are either in, or near a body of water. It balances the visual destruction of the fire.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>America</i> by The Shoes</h3>
            <p>I’ve loved this song ever since that great music video of Jake Gyllenhaal killing hipsters. The movement of this song sounds like The Shoes moving through America—it matches Tyler and his friend’s energy.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>The Light Shines Through</i> by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>This is the first time in the film Tyler truly breaks down. He shows us his vulnerability, and all that he’s been keeping inside. It’s the last moment of deep connection with his sister Emily before tragedy hits and will be an important moment that stays with her forever. The piano melody theme is my favorite of the film because it’s deeply personal to me. Trent and Atticus sent me this track when I was going through a hard time, and I started crying as soon as I heard it. This song is the heart of the film—beauty fighting through pain, and someone trying to heal. I included the album version of this track here. In the film the track is the same melody but stripped down.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Focus</i> by H.E.R</h3>
            <p>Kelvin took this glorious video of Alexis dancing to this song the first time they met, and so, naturally, the song became part of the film, but it wasn’t originally in the script. You really start to see Alexis’ spirit coming through in this song—to me, it sounds exactly like a relationship that’s struggling, nearing an end. I like the dialogue happening between this track and the next one, both characters struggling to express how they feel with their lovers.
                <i>Can you focus on me?<br>
                    Baby, can you focus on me?<br>
                    Can’t you see?<br>
                    I just wanna love you, baby</i></p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>IFHY (feat Pharrell)</i> by Tyler The Creator</h3>
            <p><i>I fucking hate you, but I love you<br>
                I’m bad at keeping my emotions bubbled<br>
                You’re good at being perfect<br>
                We’re good at being troubled<br></i>
                I fucking LOVE this song. IFHY feels like every adolescent love song I grew up with. When I was in high school, I destroyed my room over a girlfriend, while a song like this was playing—it may have been juvenile but it felt honest. For better or worse, music gets me through things, and it’s why I wanted a soundtrack that always felt honest to Tyler and Emily’s experiences.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Surf Solar</i> by Fuck Buttons</h3>
            <p>This song has propulsion and drive, and feels authentic to Tyler’s experience. Even when we aren’t with Tyler in this sequence, it’s what you imagine an angry teenage experience of FOMO sounds like.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Love is a Losing Game</i> by Amy Winehouse</h3>
            <p>This song is a timeless classic from Amy Winehouse, it comes in as we are shifting from Tyler’s perspective, and moving over to Emily’s. As one of my favorite Amy tracks, this song comes in at the end of one of my favorite scenes. After getting beaten up for a while, I wanted to pause, and have a scene where these two young women could connect with each other—everyone’s whole night should be as enjoyable as this scene. I love the look on Alexis’s face when she’s dancing to this song.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>I Am a God</i> by Kanye West</h3>
            <p>Getting the rights was hard and took a long time, and we didn’t clear the song until after Telluride and Toronto. Thankfully Kanye came through because I love every song off of <i>YEEZUS</i>. We tried a million other songs and nothing worked. I wanted the strength and power of the lyrics “I Am A God” right after Tyler overpowers his father. It feels so tragic, like a panic attack coming out of Tyler’s head. I love the way Johnnie Burn infuses his sound design with the track and the way we mixed it.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>U-Rite / U-Rite (Louis Futon Remix)</i> by THEY</h3>
            <p>We played this scene out in a single take, which is why this song feels so right for the moment, like a nervous warning. We wanted everyone in this scene to have music to actually interact with, so we played the song live so that it could feel like a real party. Playing music on set can be huge in channeling the right energy. In the film, the end of this track goes into Trent and Atticus’ score that again brings us to Tyler’s state of mind. Combining the original and a remix made it feel more unique and dynamic. I like that the lyrics bring us back to <i>Backseat Freestyle</i>and that teenage state of mind.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Be Above It (Erol Alkan Rework)</i> by Tame Impala</h3>
            <p>Using this song again just shows us how far Tyler has fallen from where he was. It breaks my heart.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Ghost</i> by Kid Cudi</h3>
            <p>The people I've met and the places I’ve been<br>
                Are all what make me the man I so proudly am<br>
                But I wanna know one thing<br>
                When did I become a ghost?<br>
                I'm most confused about the world I live in<br>
                You think that I’m lonely, well I probably am <br>
                One thing that still gets me
                <br>When did I become a ghost?</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>The Stars In His Head (Dark Lights Remix)</i> by Colin Stetson</h3>
            <p>I am really inspired by Colin Stetson's work. It is so urgent, primal, and scary. Feels like a nightmare coming true—a primal howl into the night. I talked a lot with Sterling about this sequence in the film: It had to feel like spiraling out of control, Tyler's worst nightmare coming true, and the impact this tragedy has on everyone. Both Tyler and Emily's stories are supremely subjective and strictly from their point of view until we get to the end of each story, when they spiral out of control and we feel the interconnectivity of everyone.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>After the Fire</i> by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>This is the continuation of the theme set up by Trent and Atticus between Tyler and Alexis at the fire. The goal was to feel the full devastating weight of this tragedy. For me, it sounds like the film is in a state of shock, devastation, and mourning— everyone's lives changed forever. When I was editing this sequence, I cried uncontrollably for several hours. This song acts as a spiritual transfer from brother to sister. Emily is being birthed out of a tunnel of darkness, and then entering the light to start a new chapter.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Wounds Heal</i> by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>This is the original 22-minute track that Trent and Atticus sent me but the version in the film is slightly different. This track is what gets us into Emily's headspace—isolated and in deep grief. The piano theme used here is her spirit trying to get through. This is the second we use the piano theme; it started in the bathroom with Tyler and Emily earlier in the film. It felt right to use it again here for a multitude of reasons. Even though we’re in a state of grief, the film is coming into a new beginning.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>How to Begin</i> by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</h3>
            <p>It's always scary opening yourself up to someone new, especially after everything Emily's been through. This song plays with that balance and dichotomy, she's curious but on guard—hopeful but cautious.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>Moonlight Serenade</i> by Glenn Miller</h3>
            <p>This is the first piece of music we hear that's not score, since the tragedy. It's timeless, beautiful and hopeful. It's also a very personal song between my girlfriend and I. It was always hard for me to get into swing until her.</p>
            <hr style="border-bottom: 4px dotted"; />

            <h3><i style= color:#FFA364>What a Difference a Day Makes</i> by Dinah Washington</h3>
            <p>Since this is a film about dichotomies, it was important for me to have moments that called out and mirrored each other. Returning to the diner and using this song again is obviously important to Emily and her family history. It is a small moment in the spirit of the film where we see music used to get through painful times. This song pushes Emily to open up in a way she wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
