            The album and its songs were nominated for four Grammy Awards, while SZA was nominated for Best New Artist. It was also included in several year-end best music lists by publications. 
            In 2020, the album was ranked at 472 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. </p>
